Developer Square is our public community site for sharing, discussing,
connect and learning. The main DevSq.net page offers an index of the
content and resources we are promoting and sharing, while the “Talk”
site (https://talk.developersquare.net) is a full fledged community
discussion site focused on open-source, mobile app development.

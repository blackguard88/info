the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

statement to make it clear that all of our code is available for any
effort to end the COVID Pandemic.

We grant to every person and entity that wishes to accept it, a
non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid-up license to fully
use, practice and exploit all our patent and copyright rights, for the
sole purpose of ending the COVID-19 pandemic and minimising the impact
of the disease, including diagnosis, prevention, containment, and
treatment.

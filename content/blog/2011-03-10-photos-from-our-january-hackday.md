Back in January, we held a very excellent hackday at [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org) in New York. We rooted a NookColor, made encrypted calls over SIP, and generally had a full day of talking about the state of mobile security and privacy. Thanks to everyone who attended, and many thanks to _hc and Eyebeam forÂ hosting!

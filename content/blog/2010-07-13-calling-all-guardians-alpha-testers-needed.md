Recently here at the Guardian Project we’ve been brainstorming & designing a new tool that we think will be core to enabling truly protected mobile communications . We think it will a big step in improving the user-friendliness of making your communications secure, anonymous and private , but we need your help to make it great.

While it may give some of us a certain satisfaction to manually cobble together a suite of secure applications that suites our needs, this is by no means a long-term, wider-market solution. The tech community often forget (willfully or otherwise) that there is a huge group of non tech-savvy users for whom security and privacy are top level priorities. The ability to secure ones mobile communications should be accessible to all, through a solution that is beautiful, engaging and idiot-proof in its design. As we try to build that solution, we’re looking for your help in making sure that it meets each of those criteria.

As an alpha tester, your job will be to help us shape the product. We’ll want to know everything about your mobile device(s), how you use them to communicate,  what concerns you have about privacy, and how you interact with the products we’re building. In turn we’ll provide you with expert assistance and knowledge about mobile privacy. You’ll get the latest glimpses at our designs and beta versions of our component applications. You will live and breathe mobile anonymity (if you so choose), and you’ll play a key role in defining the future of Guardian.

Prerequisites:

  * Has Android mobile device(s)
  * Highly invested in mobile privacy
  * Willing to regularly engage with the Guardian team through phone calls, online forums & surveys, etc. (at least once per week)
  * Preferably a part of an organization >3 people also matching the above criteria

If this sounds like you, we want to hear from you. Fill out a quick contact form [here](https://guardianproject.info/contact/alpha-testers-apply-here/).

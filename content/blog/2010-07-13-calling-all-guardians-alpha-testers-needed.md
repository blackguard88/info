Recently here at the Guardian Project we&#8217;ve been brainstorming & designing a new tool that we think will be core to enabling truly protected mobile communications . We think it will a big step in improving the user-friendliness of making your communications secure, anonymous and private , but we need your help to make it great.

While it may give some of us a certain satisfaction to manually cobble together a suite of secure applications that suites our needs, this is by no means a long-term, wider-market solution. The tech community often forget (willfully or otherwise) that there is a huge group of non tech-savvy users for whom security and privacy are top level priorities. The ability to secure ones mobile communications should be accessible to all, through a solution that is beautiful, engaging and idiot-proof in its design. As we try to build that solution, we&#8217;re looking for your help in making sure that it meets each of those criteria.

As an alpha tester, your job will be to help us shape the product. We&#8217;ll want to know everything about your mobile device(s), how you use them to communicate,  what concerns you have about privacy, and how you interact with the products we&#8217;re building. In turn we&#8217;ll provide you with expert assistance and knowledge about mobile privacy. You&#8217;ll get the latest glimpses at our designs and beta versions of our component applications. You will live and breathe mobile anonymity (if you so choose), and you&#8217;ll play a key role in defining the future of Guardian.

Prerequisites:

  * Has Android mobile device(s)
  * Highly invested in mobile privacy
  * Willing to regularly engage with the Guardian team through phone calls, online forums & surveys, etc. (at least once per week)
  * Preferably a part of an organization >3 people also matching the above criteria

If this sounds like you, we want to hear from you. Fill out a quick contact form [here](http://guardianproject.info/contact/alpha-testers-apply-here/).

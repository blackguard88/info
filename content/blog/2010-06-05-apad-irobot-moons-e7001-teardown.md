This is the aPad or iRobot Android 7″ tablet device from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.hiapad.com/">www.hiapad.com</a>. I decided to tear mine apart, as the unit I received has a battery issue, and I hoped to see if I could find a bad solder point. In addition, I was curious to see just how hackable or extensible the hardware was. In the end, I was mostly surprised by how much of the thing is put together with tape. I suppose that is what you get for < $200 Android tablet! You can find the [full product overview on the Hiapad site](http://www.hiapad.com/?p=9&lang=en). I have also pasted in the basic specs below.

p.s. – the older, distinguished gentleman in the photos is my father, who at age 75, is still fascinated, engaged, and into hacking with all things digital.

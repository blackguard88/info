Here’s a few screenshots of the new “ACTIVATE ORBOT!” user interface. Just polishing up some of the features and doing a last few days of diligent testing before we release to the wider public.

Overall, we want Tor on Android to be a one touch type experience, while still offering all the necessary options for configuration of bridges, rate limiting, etc.

The coolest Android-only feature, which unfortunately requires your device to be rooted, is the ability to choose which apps on your device will be “Torified” automatically and transparently.

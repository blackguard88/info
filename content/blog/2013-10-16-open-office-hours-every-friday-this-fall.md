          Members of the Guardian Project will be hosting <a href="https://plus.google.com/events/cumq8tucoc31ap55iqdn7pq9abs">weekly public hangouts</a> every Friday for the rest of year to answer questions about our apps (Orbot, Orweb, ChatSecure), building on our mobile security libraries (IOCipher, SQLCipher, NetCipher) and using services like OStel (including how to run your own secure phone service!).</p> 
          
          <p>
            We will also be live in IRC on Freenode at <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23guardianproject">#guardianproject</a>  as always for those of you who don’t feel the need to be on camera.

The [InsecureSystem blog](http://www.insecuresystem.org/2010/04/ultimate-droid-and-orbot.html) has a nice write-up on how to get Orbot running on your Droid:

> I’ve always been a supporter of net privacy and Tor in particular, and a friend of mine got me interested in [the guardian project](https://guardianproject.info/), so I grabbed the beta version of [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/) just to try it out.. sweet, tor from my phone.

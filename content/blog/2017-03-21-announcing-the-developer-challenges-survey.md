<span style="font-weight: 400">In the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Guardian Project</span>](https://guardianproject.info/)<span style="font-weight: 400">‘s current work with the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">FDroid</span>](https://f-droid.org/) <span style="font-weight: 400">community to make it a secure, streamlined, and verifiable app distribution channel for high-risk environments we have started to become more aware of the challenges and risks facing software developers who build software in around the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">There are a wealth of resources available on how to support and collaborate with high-risk users. Surprisingly, we could not find any guidance on how to support and collaborate with developers where the internet is heavily monitored and/or filtered, let alone developers who might be at risk because of the software they develop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">We have started <a href="https://guardianproject.info/2017/01/26/imagining-the-challenges-of-developers-in-repressive-environments/">conducting research</a> on developers from a range of closed and closing spaces. We hope that the results of this research will help international software projects and organizations better understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">Part of this user research was the development of the </span>**[challenges.tech survey](https://challenges.tech/)** <span style="font-weight: 400">which will be used to help us form a better understanding of the challenges international developers face, their motivations, and their priorities. With the help of the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Localization Lab</span>](https://www.localizationlab.org/) <span style="font-weight: 400">we have translated this survey into <a href="https://challenges.tech/?lang=zh">Chinese</a>, <a href="https://challenges.tech/?lang=es">Spanish</a>, <a href="https://challenges.tech/?lang=fa">Farsi</a>, <a href="https://challenges.tech/?lang=ru">Russian</a>, <a href="https://www.challenges.tech/?lang=fr">French</a>, and <a href="https://www.challenges.tech">English</a>.</span>

 

<span style="font-weight: 400">We have two requests:</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">If you are a developer take</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong><a href="https://www.challenges.tech/"> the survey</a></strong>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> (<em>It takes about 10 minutes.</em>)</span>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">
  <span style="font-weight: 400">Share the survey with your networks and encourage them to pass it along. We would like to get a diverse range of developers to take the survey.</span>
</li>

 

<span style="font-weight: 400">We will close down the survey in a month. We will then replace the challenges.tech website with the aggregated survey results. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">We will also publicly share the overall results of our research on the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Guardian Project</span>](https://guardianproject.info/) <span style="font-weight: 400">website in a research report. We hope that this report will help international organizations and software development projects understand and respond to the unique needs of different international developer communities.</span>

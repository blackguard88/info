It&#8217;s here! We&#8217;d like to officially announce the release of [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/) to the Android Market. After [going beta](https://guardianproject.info/2010/03/04/orbot-goes-beta/) back in March, we&#8217;ve seriously re-doubled our efforts for this release. By releasing Orbot to the Android Market, we suspect that our user base will eventually evolve towards the more &#8216;every day&#8217; Android user &#8211; so our goal has been to create an experience that is simple yet informative, straightforward yet powerful. As a step towards that goal, we&#8217;ve spent some time creating a new [setup wizard at Orbot start-up](https://guardianproject.info/2010/07/29/orbot-update-new-setup-wizard-at-startup/) that walks you through the basics of what Orbot does and does not do. The last thing we want is for someone to be endangered because they didn&#8217;t understand how to protect themselves.

We&#8217;ve also spent the time fixing bugs, patching potential security holes, and bringing a bunch of new features to Orbot, including:

  * &#8216;Start on boot&#8217; option <&#8211; set to &#8216;on&#8217; by default
  * <span style="font-size: 13.1944px;">Support for Hidden Services (!!)</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 13.1944px;">Re-designed per-app torification and application settings</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 13.1944px;">Easy access to the official Tor &#8216;check&#8217; site through application menu</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 13.1944px;">&#8230;not to mention a complete application architecture overhaul! (hopefully translating to increasedÂ stability)</span>

We&#8217;re especially excited about Hidden Services support in this release, and we&#8217;ve been hacking away at a proof of concept application that shows how powerful this tool can become &#8211; hopefully we will be posting about it soon.

So now for the juicy stuff. Grab the 1.0 release from the doubletwist Android web app store [here](http://www.doubletwist.com/apps/android/orbot-tor-on-android/-8175007413332940359), by scanning the QR Code below, or just searching the Market for &#8216;Orbot.&#8217;

If you&#8217;re new to the Guardian Project, we&#8217;d like to make sure you know that all of our official builds are available from the Tor [website](http://www.torproject.org/dist/android/). We&#8217;re also proud to be an open-source project &#8211; if you&#8217;d like to read more about Orbot or would like to reproduce our builds from source, check out the [subversion repository](https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/android/trunk/Orbot/).

As always we&#8217;d like to thank the dedicated team of developers, testers and enthusiasts that have provided feedback throughout Orbot&#8217;s development. We&#8217;ve tested on Android 1.x and 2.x devices such as the MyTouch, Nexus One and Motorola Droid [we also did port to a Nook ðŸ˜‰ ] &#8211; so we&#8217;d love to get feedback on performance and functionality on any and all of the ever growing family of Android devices. Please report bugs and feedback [here](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor).

As we&#8217;ve [posted](https://guardianproject.info/2010/11/09/secured-t-mobile-mytouch-4g-gets-guardian/) in the past, one of the services we provide at The Guardian Project is customizing off-the-shelf Android phones to be generally more secure, privacy minded and updated with a powerful suite of trusted apps. We&#8217;ve gotten our mitts on a number of devices over the last few months in this regard, including: myTouch 4G, Motorola Milestone (GSM Droid), HTC Desire GSM, TMobile G2, Samsung Galaxy S, Nook Color, and Viewsonic 10&#8243; GTablet. Whew! And if there&#8217;s one thing we&#8217;ve learned, it&#8217;s that some devices are much much harder to crack than others (cough cough&#8230; [Desire GSM&#8217;s hardened bootloader](http://alpharev.nl/)). With that in mind, we&#8217;ve recently added a [Hardware](https://guardianproject.info/hardware/) page to our site that lists the devices that we recommend for &#8216;Guardianization&#8217;.

This weekend we got our hands on one of the devices that has recently made our list &#8211; the [HTC Wildfire A3333](http://www.htc.com/uk/product/wildfire/overview.html). As far as trade-offs are concerned, the Wildfire is like a &#8216;mini me&#8217; version of our trusted Nexus One &#8211; a smaller, lower resolution capacitive screen along with a processor with half the speed means much improved battery life and a fuller wallet (just $300 / ea.!).

Our app suite has been evolving along with our hardware preferences: we still rely on Orbot (Tor on Android), TextSecure, K9 & APG. OtRChat has become Gibberbot and is currently in alpha status, and SipDroid has been replaced with CSipSimple, a very powerful sip client that provides SRTP-encrypted voice over TLS. More on CSip in a future blog posting.

We&#8217;re very happy with how these Wildfires have turned out &#8211; Cyanogenmod 6 firmware is very responsive and stable and the hardware is very convenient. As long as they stay straightforward to customize they&#8217;ll be staying on our &#8216;good list&#8217; down the road.

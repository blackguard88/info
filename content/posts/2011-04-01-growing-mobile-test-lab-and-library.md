At our new meatspace location in New York City, we are building up a library of mobile devices from around the world for open-source developers to use for testing, and specifically to help verify the security of apps running on different carrier configurations and hardware variables.

Mostly our collection has come from picking up what we can, when we can, always with an eye towards anything a few generations back from the state of the art. IfÂ you&#8217;ve got any mobile hardware to donate, we would love to have it.

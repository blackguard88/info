One of the services we provide at the Guardian Project is taking any off the shelf Android phone and setting it up to be generally more secure, privacy minded and updated with a powerful suite of trusted apps. Today we were excited to get our hands on a myTouch 4G, manufactured by HTC and sold by T-Mobile. Really beautiful piece of hardware, and once we got our hands on it, a powerhouse of encrypted, anonymous and circumventing communications.

Brief list of our current trusted app suite (not all are open-source but they are tested/vetted as best we can otherwise): Orbot (Tor on Android), Firefox with ProxyMob add-on, TextSecure, OtRChat, RedPhone, SipDroid with VPN, DroidTracker, Norton Mobile Security Suite, Android Privacy Guard with K9Mail for GPG, OISafe and OINotes for locally encrypted data collection and more!

All in all, through our own development work and the larger Android security community, things are really coming together. With hardware like the 4G, it can all be put into a shiny, blazing package.

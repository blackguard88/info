  If you are an activist or represent an NGO or other organization interested in getting access to Guardian-enabled mobile phones, please <a href="/contact">let us know</a>. We are always interested in finding new partners to work with.

  <em>Note: this project receives grants and sub-contracts from organizations (such as the Open Technology Fund) and research projects (such as the Tor Project) that receive funding from the U.S. Government and other governments around the world. None of this funding has modified or shaped our development plans, and we would never, ever put any sort of backdoor or compromised component into our software based on this funding.</em>

**Freedom of the Press Foundation**

We received funding in 2017 and support for a [crowdfunding effort](https://freedom.press/donate-support-haven-open-source-project/) from FPF related to our work on Haven.

**Eric and Wendy Schmidt Foundation**

In 2014, we received a generous grant from the [New Digital Age Grants program](https://guardianproject.info/2014/03/10/eric-schmidt-awards-guardian-project-a-new-digital-age-grant/).

In 2012, we received funding for our [InformaCam project](/apps/informacam), and related supporting technologies from <a style="font-size: 13px;" href="https://guardianproject.info/2013/01/27/informacam-wins-knight-news-challenge/">Knight News Challenge</a>

**Google**

In January 2011, the Guardian Project received a no strings attached donation from Google. We used this funding to accelerate our development activities in various areas, host developer events, produce audits and guides, and support activists in the field. This should not be seen as any formal endorsement of our work by Google corporate, hence we are not putting their logo here.
